# Governance

This document describes how the **Starlight Programming Language** project is governed and how decisions are made.

Starlight is an **open, community-driven project** with a clear leadership model to ensure long-term stability, clarity, and growth.

---

## Project Leadership

Starlight is currently led and maintained by:

- **Project Creator & Lead Maintainer:** Macedon

The Lead Maintainer has final decision-making authority and is responsible for:
- Project vision and direction
- Language design decisions
- Release management
- Approving or rejecting major changes
- Resolving conflicts when consensus cannot be reached

---

## Decision-Making Process

### 1. Consensus First
Whenever possible, decisions are made through:
- GitHub Issues
- Pull Request discussions
- Community feedback

Constructive discussion and consensus are strongly encouraged.

### 2. Final Authority
If consensus cannot be reached, the Lead Maintainer makes the final decision.

This model ensures:
- Consistency in language design
- Clear technical direction
- Fast resolution of blocking issues

## Contributions & Influence

Anyone can contribute to Starlight.

Influence in the project is earned through:
- High-quality contributions
- Helpful reviews and discussions
- Consistent participation
- Respectful collaboration

There are currently no formal roles such as "core team" or "committee", but this may evolve as the project grows.

---

## Roadmap & Vision

The long-term vision and roadmap are documented in:
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)

The roadmap is:
- Maintained by the Lead Maintainer
- Informed by community feedback
- Updated as the language evolves

---

## Changes to Governance

This governance model may change over time as the project scales.

Any significant governance changes will be:
- Documented in this file
- Discussed publicly
- Clearly communicated to contributors

---

## Conflict Resolution

In case of disputes:
1. Attempt respectful discussion
2. Seek clarification and compromise
3. Escalate to the Lead Maintainer if unresolved

Harassment, abuse, or repeated bad-faith behavior will be handled according to the  
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

## Transparency

All major decisions should be:
- Documented in GitHub Issues or Pull Requests
- Publicly visible
- Justified with clear reasoning when possible

---

## Acknowledgement

Starlight exists because of its community.  
Every contribution — code, documentation, ideas, or feedback — helps shape the language.

Thank you for being part of the journey ✨
