## Early Inspiration

From an early age, I was fascinated by technology and problem-solving. My journey started with a simple goal: **to make my father's job easier**. Observing his work, I realized that customers often had to meet him in person to submit items, which was time-consuming. I wanted to create a solution that would allow customers to communicate and submit requests without physically visiting him.

This led me to develop a **local chat system** using **MySQL, PHP, HTML, and CSS**. The project was small but significant. I immediately understood that **if a group of people could contact a single person, I could build a one-to-one chat interface**. I implemented it, and it worked, marking my first success in building functional communication systems.

## Web Development and GitHub

After creating the local chat system, I expanded my skills into **web development**. Using **GitHub**, I hosted projects and began experimenting with website creation and deployment. These early experiences helped me understand version control, collaboration, and project management in real-world software development.

## Android Development: Falcon S

Later, I ventured into **Android development** and built a **messaging app called Falcon S**. This project used **Android Studio**, **Firebase Auth**, **Realtime DB**, **Firestore**, and **Storage**. The journey was challenging:

* Dealing with **long Gradle builds**
* Correctly adding **google-services.json**, a notoriously difficult part of Android development
* Generating **keystores** and ensuring **version codes** matched

Through persistence, I successfully built the app, gaining deep experience in mobile application architecture, authentication, and real-time data management.

## Desktop and Video Call Applications

To expand communication tools, I developed a **video call room** similar to **Zoom**:

* **Desktop:** using **Electron**
* **Android app:** using **WebView**
* **Signaling server:** using **Supabase**

This project tested my ability to integrate cross-platform systems and manage real-time communication at scale.

## Rendering Engine and React Native

Next, I attempted to create a **rendering engine** to render **views directly from JSON**. Though this project ultimately failed, it taught me valuable lessons about design systems, parsing, and dynamic UI rendering.

Afterwards, I moved to **React Native and Expo**, successfully rebuilding a messaging app with a **CSS-like stylesheet design**. This solidified my understanding of cross-platform mobile development and modern UI frameworks.

---

## Starlight Programming Language

Finally, my experiences led me to develop the **Starlight Programming Language**.
Starlight is **based on the rendering engine concept** I had explored earlier, combining ideas from my web, mobile, and desktop projects to create a language that is **flexible, interactive, and user-friendly**.

My work with Starlight continues to evolve, reflecting my passion for **communication systems, rendering engines, and innovative programming tools**.

## Summary

Throughout my journey:

* I have built **local chat systems, websites, Android apps, and desktop apps**
* I have faced and solved challenges in **authentication, real-time databases, keystores, Gradle builds, signaling servers, and UI rendering**
* I have learned that **persistence, experimentation, and understanding user needs** are the keys to successful development

I am **Dominex Macedon**, a **developer, innovator, and creator**, dedicated to building tools that make communication seamless and intuitive.
