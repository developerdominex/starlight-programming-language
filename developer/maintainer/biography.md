## early inspiration

from an early age, i was fascinated by technology and problem-solving. my journey started with a simple goal: **to make my father's job easier**. observing his work, i realized that customers often had to meet him in person to submit items, which was time-consuming. i wanted to create a solution that would allow customers to communicate and submit requests without physically visiting him.  

this led me to develop a **local chat system** using **mysql, php, html, and css**. the project was small but significant. i immediately understood that **if a group of people could contact a single person, i could build a one-to-one chat interface**. i implemented it, and it worked, marking my first success in building functional communication systems.

## web development and github

after creating the local chat system, i expanded my skills into **web development**. using **github**, i hosted projects and began experimenting with website creation and deployment. these early experiences helped me understand version control, collaboration, and project management in real-world software development.

## android development: falcon s

later, i ventured into **android development** and built a **messaging app called Falcon S**. this project used **android studio**, **firebase auth**, **realtime db**, **firestore**, and **storage**. the journey was challenging:

- dealing with **long gradle builds**  
- correctly adding **google-services.json**, a notoriously difficult part of android development  
- generating **keystores** and ensuring **version codes** matched  

through persistence, i successfully built the app, gaining deep experience in mobile application architecture, authentication, and real-time data management.

## desktop and video call applications

to expand communication tools, i developed a **video call room** similar to **Zoom**:

- **desktop**: using **Electron**  
- **android app**: using **WebView**  
- **signaling server**: using **Supabase**  

this project tested my ability to integrate cross-platform systems and manage real-time communication at scale.

## rendering engine and react native

next, i attempted to create a **rendering engine** to render **views directly from JSON**. though this project ultimately failed, it taught me valuable lessons about design systems, parsing, and dynamic UI rendering.  

afterwards, i moved to **React Native and Expo**, successfully rebuilding a messaging app with a **CSS-like stylesheet design**. this solidified my understanding of cross-platform mobile development and modern UI frameworks.

## starlight programming language

finally, my experiences led me to develop the **Starlight Programming Language**.  
Starlight is **based on the rendering engine concept** I had explored earlier, combining ideas from my web, mobile, and desktop projects to create a language that is **flexible, interactive, and user-friendly**.  

my work with Starlight continues to evolve, reflecting my passion for **communication systems, rendering engines, and innovative programming tools**.

## summary

throughout my journey:

- i have built **local chat systems, websites, android apps, and desktop apps**  
- i have faced and solved challenges in **authentication, real-time databases, keystores, gradle builds, signaling servers, and UI rendering**  
- i have learned that **persistence, experimentation, and understanding user needs** are the keys to successful development  

I am dominex macedon, a **developer, innovator, and creator**, dedicated to building tools that make communication seamless and intuitive.
